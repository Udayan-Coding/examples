        There’s a lot of hype around coding, so let’s start by clarifying what
        coding isn’t. I mentioned above that when I first saw the source code of
        a web page, I thought that I was looking at the language my computer
        spoke. This is a common way of explaining what code is, but it’s not
        exactly true. Your computer doesn’t understand the nuances of language.
        In fact, the only terms your computer understands very well at all are
        “Yes” or “No.” Imagine you are building a bridge with a group of
        engineers. You’re on one side, they are on the other, and you need to
        communicate to finish the project. The problem is, your phone has died,
        and your radio only works one way. All you have to communicate with them
        is a flashlight. One flash for yes, two for no. It will take a while
        but, eventually, the bridge will be built. This is how a computer
        communicates with people. The language the computer speaks is binary
        code, a mathematical language of ones and zeros. Just like the
        flashlight, there are only two options. The computer understands “on”
        and “off,” and nothing else. So unless you’re typing strings of ones and
        zeros into your text editor (which you’re not), you’re not really
        writing code in the computer’s language. But if the code isn’t written
        in the computer’s language, what are you doing?
